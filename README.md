Anodroid is a 10-DOF humanoid-robot. It is an integrated machine that can walk and run, in flat surfaces, in tilted surfaces etcetera. It consists of:
- 13 single axis model motors. 10 needed, 3 for backup
- 20 Circular rotating shafts for the motors, 10 needed, 10 for backup 
- 60 M3*7 screws and nuts, 50 needed, 10 for backup
- 20 sets of axial motor equipments, including an M3*10 screw, a rotating axis, and an M3 nut
- 60 M3*5 nuts and screws, 50 needed, 10 for backup
- An arduino controller board
- 50 sets of nuts and bolts for M4*8 screw, used to secure the screw and motor. 40 are needed, 10 are for backup
- Many rolls of PLA plastic, used for 3D printing
- A 3D printer and 3D printing software

Ideally, one should also have a recent version of DS Solidworks.
