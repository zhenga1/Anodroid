Date Completed: 8/5
Main Changes:

Remeasured and changed the width of the motor-assembly, which was causing problems during assembly. The 
width of the motor-assembly was too short, by 2 millimeters. It was meant to be around 53-53.8mm in length, however
my initial measurements yielded only 51.5.

Reasons for error:
Partially due to inaccurate measurement of Motor SR-1501, including the thickness of the rotatory shaft, and the respective
lengths between the motor holes and each of the ends. This accounted for roughly 0.3-0.4mm of error
Mostly due to the inconsideration of printing inaccuracies: Many distances printed by the 3D printer were longer than they were
meant to be. The thickness of the Holder part itself, for instance, at the ends were meant to be 2mm, however it was printed
2.4mm. The real part's length from the Holder's motor-hole to the ends were also enlarged by roughly a millimetre. Which led to
the error. 

Components affected:
- All main parts apart from Pelvis part, including Foot, Thigh and Shin parts.
