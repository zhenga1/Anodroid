Problems:
After testing of new printed parts, I realised that:
1) The hole for my axial bearing is slightly small. The sketch was correct but the 3D-printer shrank my designed hole 
dimension by roughly 0.2-0.3mm
2) The shin part that I designed causes collisions during servo rotations. I considered the collisions between initial servos but didn't
consider possible collisions between the thigh and the shin.
3) The hip part is too big, and when balancing on one foot, can result in a large torque.
4) The holder part needs to be edited as the two sides that come up and connect to the motor are too brittle and too easily broken. 
That part needs to be made thicker.
5) The thigh part is-(possibly too long and needs to be fixed)

Changes:
1) Expand the diameter by 0.3 to 8.3.
